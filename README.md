Leverage the pre-trained MobileNet network for transfer learning, aiming to achieve high accuracy in classifying images across the 100 categories of the CIFAR-100 dataset.

*MobileNet network: The pre-trained model used as the starting point for transfer learning.

*Transfer learning: The approach of utilizing the learned features from MobileNet on a new, smaller dataset (CIFAR-100) for improved classification accuracy.

It reaches an accuracy of 94% in training set and 68% in testing set.
